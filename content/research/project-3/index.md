<!-- <h2 style="font-weight: normal">Background</h2>
Over the course of the last two decades, it became progressively clear that physical, i.e.
mechanical forces play a major role in cellular decision making and aid in regulating important
physiological processes like tissue growth and morphogenesis. To actively generate forces, cells
use a highly complex and self-organized contractile structure called the actin cytoskeleton which
allows them to explore the mechanical and geometric properties of their environment through cell-
matrix and cell-cell adhesions. These informations are then fed back to the cell, and evaluated by
means of chemical signals a process which is known as mechanotransduction. Although research
has yielded many new insights in recent years it is still puzzling how cells integrate information
from their environment into their decision-making process. Therefore, it is important to study how
cells generate forces, how the internal molecular machinery regulates them, and how these forces
transmit information in multicellular systems to understand processes such as development,
organogenesis, homeostasis or diseases like cancer. -->

Many cellular structures, like the centriole, rely on precise protein self-assembly to build complex shapes with defined symmetries. The protein SAS-6 is essential for centriole formation because it forms dimers that self-assemble into nine-fold symmetric rings, establishing the centrioleâ€™s architecture. Recent experiments show that surfaces strongly promote this ring assembly by increasing encounter rates and forcing the structure to stay planar. In my work, I use Brownian dynamics simulations and reaction kinetics to study how surface adsorption, interaction energies, and angular constraints shape the efficiency and symmetry of SAS-6 ring formation, highlighting the physical conditions that favor robust and specific assembly.

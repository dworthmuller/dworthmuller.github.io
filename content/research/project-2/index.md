<!-- <h2 style="font-weight: normal">Background</h2>
Over the course of the last two decades, it became progressively clear that physical, i.e.
mechanical forces play a major role in cellular decision making and aid in regulating important
physiological processes like tissue growth and morphogenesis. To actively generate forces, cells
use a highly complex and self-organized contractile structure called the actin cytoskeleton which
allows them to explore the mechanical and geometric properties of their environment through cell-
matrix and cell-cell adhesions. These informations are then fed back to the cell, and evaluated by
means of chemical signals a process which is known as mechanotransduction. Although research
has yielded many new insights in recent years it is still puzzling how cells integrate information
from their environment into their decision-making process. Therefore, it is important to study how
cells generate forces, how the internal molecular machinery regulates them, and how these forces
transmit information in multicellular systems to understand processes such as development,
organogenesis, homeostasis or diseases like cancer. -->

### <h2 style="font-weight: normal">Optogenetic Control of Cell Contarctility and Force Propagation</h2>
Cells generate and propagate contractile forces to sense, adapt, and maintain mechanical balance with their environment. While the basics of pulling forces are well known, the physical principles that link force generation within the cytoskeleton to force propagation across cells and tissues remain poorly understood. My research combines optogenetics, micropatterning, traction force microscopy, and continuum theory to reveal how actin architecture, cell size, and geometry shape both local force generation and long-range force transmission. By bridging experiments and active gel models, I aim to explain how cells dynamically regulate tension and coordinate mechanical signals at multiple scales.

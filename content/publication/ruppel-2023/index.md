abstract: Cell-generated forces play a major role in coordinating the large-scale
  behavior of cell assemblies, in particular during development, wound healing, and
  cancer. Mechanical signals propagate faster than biochemical signals, but can have
  similar effects, especially in epithelial tissues with strong cell–cell adhesion.
  However, a quantitative description of the transmission chain from force generation
  in a sender cell, force propagation across cell–cell boundaries, and the concomitant
  response of receiver cells is missing. For a quantitative analysis of this important
  situation, here we propose a minimal model system of two epithelial cells on an
  H-pattern (‘cell doublet’). After optogenetically activating RhoA, a major regulator
  of cell contractility, in the sender cell, we measure the mechanical response of
  the receiver cell by traction force and monolayer stress microscopies. In general,
  we find that the receiver cells show an active response so that the cell doublet
  forms a coherent unit. However, force propagation and response of the receiver cell
  also strongly depend on the mechano-structural polarization in the cell assembly,
  which is controlled by cell–matrix adhesion to the adhesive micropattern. We find
  that the response of the receiver cell is stronger when the mechano-structural polarization
  axis is oriented perpendicular to the direction of force propagation, reminiscent
  of the Poisson effect in passive materials. We finally show that the same effects
  are at work in small tissues. Our work demonstrates that cellular organization and
  active mechanical response of a tissue are key to maintain signal strength and lead
  to the emergence of elasticity, which means that signals are not dissipated like
  in a viscous system, but can propagate over large distances.

abstract: The Spindle Assembly Abnormal Protein 6 (SAS-6) forms dimers, which then
  self-assemble into rings that are critical for the nine-fold symmetry of the centriole
  organelle. It has recently been shown experimentally that the self-assembly of SAS-6
  rings is strongly facilitated on a surface, shifting the reaction equilibrium by
  four orders of magnitude compared to the bulk. Moreover, a fraction of non-canonical
  symmetries (i.e., different from nine) was observed. In order to understand which
  aspects of the system are relevant to ensure efficient self-assembly and selection
  of the nine-fold symmetry, we have performed Brownian dynamics computer simulation
  with patchy particles and then compared our results with the experimental ones.
  Adsorption onto the surface was simulated by a grand canonical Monte Carlo procedure
  and random sequential adsorption kinetics. Furthermore, self-assembly was described
  by Langevin equations with hydrodynamic mobility matrices. We find that as long
  as the interaction energies are weak, the assembly kinetics can be described well
  by coagulation-fragmentation equations in the reaction-limited approximation. By
  contrast, larger interaction energies lead to kinetic trapping and diffusion-limited
  assembly. We find that the selection of nine-fold symmetry requires a small value
  for the angular interaction range. These predictions are confirmed by the experimentally
  observed reaction constant and angle fluctuations. Overall, our simulations suggest
  that the SAS-6 system works at the crossover between a relatively weak binding energy
  that avoids kinetic trapping and a small angular range that favors the nine-fold
  symmetry.

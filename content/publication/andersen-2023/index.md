abstract: Adherent cells use actomyosin contractility to generate mechanical force
  and to sense the physical properties of their environment, with dramatic consequences
  for migration, division, differentiation, and fate. However, the organization of
  the actomyosin system within cells is highly variable, with its assembly and function
  being controlled by small GTPases from the Rho family. To understand better how
  activation of these regulators translates into cell-scale force generation in the
  context of different physical environments, here we combine recent advances in non-neuronal
  optogenetics with micropatterning and traction force microscopy on soft elastic
  substrates. We ﬁnd that, after whole-cell RhoA activation by the CRY2/CIBN optogenetic
  system with a short pulse of 100 ms, single cells contract on a minute timescale
  in proportion to their original traction force, before returning to their original
  tension setpoint with near perfect precision, on a longer timescale of several minutes.
  To decouple the biochemical and mechanical elements of this response, we introduce
  a mathematical model that is parametrized by ﬁts to the dynamics of the substrate
  deformation energy. We ﬁnd that the RhoA response builds up quickly on a timescale
  of 20 s, but decays slowly on a timescale of 50 s. The larger the cells and the
  more polarized their actin cytoskeleton, the more substrate deformation energy is
  generated. RhoA activation starts to saturate if optogenetic pulse length exceeds
  50 ms, revealing the intrinsic limits of biochemical activation. Together our results
  suggest that adherent cells establish tensional homeostasis by the RhoA system,
  but that the setpoint and the dynamics around it are strongly determined by cell
  size and the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton, which both are controlled by
  the extracellular environment.

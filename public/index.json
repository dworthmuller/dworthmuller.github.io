While the adherent cell layer is modeled as an ac- tively contracting viscoelastic material on an elastic foundation, different models are considered for the Rho-pathway, starting with a simple linear chain that can be solved analytically and later including direct feedback that can be solved only numer- ically. Our model predicts signal propagation as a function of coupling strength and viscoelastic time scales and identifies the conditions for optimal cell responses and wave propagation.

Mechanical signals propagate faster than biochemical signals, but can have similar effects, especially in epithelial tissues with strong cell–cell adhesion. However, a quantitative description of the transmission chain from force generation in a sender cell, force propagation across cell–cell boundaries, and the concomitant response of receiver cells is missing. For a quantitative analysis of this important situation, here we propose a minimal model system of two epithelial cells on an H-pattern (‘cell doublet’). After optogenetically activating RhoA, a major regulator of cell contractility, in the sender cell, we measure the mechanical response of the receiver cell by traction force and monolayer stress microscopies. In general, we find that the receiver cells show an active response so that the cell doublet forms a coherent unit. However, force propagation and response of the receiver cell also strongly depend on the mechano-structural polarization in the cell assembly, which is controlled by cell–matrix adhesion to the adhesive micropattern. We find that the response of the receiver cell is stronger when the mechano-structural polarization axis is oriented perpendicular to the direction of force propagation, reminiscent of the Poisson effect in passive materials. We finally show that the same effects are at work in small tissues. Our work demonstrates that cellular organization and active mechanical response of a tissue are key to maintain signal strength and lead to the emergence of elasticity, which means that signals are not dissipated like in a viscous system, but can propagate over large distances.","tags":[],"title":"Force propagation between epithelial cells depends on active coupling and mechano-structural polarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

However, the organization of the actomyosin system within cells is highly variable, with its assembly and function being controlled by small GTPases from the Rho family. To understand better how activation of these regulators translates into cell-scale force generation in the context of different physical environments, here we combine recent advances in non-neuronal optogenetics with micropatterning and traction force microscopy on soft elastic substrates. We ﬁnd that, after whole-cell RhoA activation by the CRY2/CIBN optogenetic system with a short pulse of 100 ms, single cells contract on a minute timescale in proportion to their original traction force, before returning to their original tension setpoint with near perfect precision, on a longer timescale of several minutes. To decouple the biochemical and mechanical elements of this response, we introduce a mathematical model that is parametrized by ﬁts to the dynamics of the substrate deformation energy. We ﬁnd that the RhoA response builds up quickly on a timescale of 20 s, but decays slowly on a timescale of 50 s. The larger the cells and the more polarized their actin cytoskeleton, the more substrate deformation energy is generated. RhoA activation starts to saturate if optogenetic pulse length exceeds 50 ms, revealing the intrinsic limits of biochemical activation. Together our results suggest that adherent cells establish tensional homeostasis by the RhoA system, but that the setpoint and the dynamics around it are strongly determined by cell size and the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton, which both are controlled by the extracellular environment.","tags":[],"title":"Cell size and actin architecture determine force generation in optogenetically activated cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Santiago Gomez Melo","Dennis Wörthmüller","Pierre Gönczy","Niccolo Banterle","Ulrich S.

It has recently been shown experimentally that the self-assembly of SAS-6 rings is strongly facilitated on a surface, shifting the reaction equilibrium by four orders of magnitude compared to the bulk. Moreover, a fraction of non-canonical symmetries (i.e., different from nine) was observed. In order to understand which aspects of the system are relevant to ensure efficient self-assembly and selection of the nine-fold symmetry, we have performed Brownian dynamics computer simulation with patchy particles and then compared our results with the experimental ones. Adsorption onto the surface was simulated by a grand canonical Monte Carlo procedure and random sequential adsorption kinetics. Furthermore, self-assembly was described by Langevin equations with hydrodynamic mobility matrices. We find that as long as the interaction energies are weak, the assembly kinetics can be described well by coagulation-fragmentation equations in the reaction-limited approximation. By contrast, larger interaction energies lead to kinetic trapping and diffusion-limited assembly. We find that the selection of nine-fold symmetry requires a small value for the angular interaction range. These predictions are confirmed by the experimentally observed reaction constant and angle fluctuations. Overall, our simulations suggest that the SAS-6 system works at the crossover between a relatively weak binding energy that avoids kinetic trapping and a small angular range that favors the nine-fold symmetry.","tags":[],"title":"Grand canonical Brownian dynamics simulations of adsorption and self-assembly of SAS-6 rings on a surface","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663804800,"objectID":"f715c423d3f79571e2959c0d9d76c96c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/2022-09_heidelberg/","publishdate":"2022-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022-09_heidelberg/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling optogenetic control of cell contractility and force propagation in epithelial tissue","type":"invited talk"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663545600,"objectID":"91d5ee4ce5013d2979a319c4ed68c4d9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/conferences/2022-09_heidelberg/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/2022-09_heidelberg/","section":"conferences","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology, Heidelberg, Germany","type":"conference"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662249600,"objectID":"3ca5430f18a9ee18f71d6bb80548642e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/conferences/2022-09_regensburg/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/2022-09_regensburg/","section":"conferences","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"DPG Spring Meeting of the Condensed Matter Section (SKM)","type":"conference"},{"authors":["Dennis Wörthmüller","Manuel Wöllhaf"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1613692800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622764800,"objectID":"0c540d5a6a2a65ee087b76bcf48a5b79","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/lectures/cv4gs/","publishdate":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/cv4gs/","section":"lectures","summary":"This class is a general introduction to Computer Vision methods relevant in geosciences.

While the role of pulling forces in sensing and migration is well established, how pushing forces allow cells to deform soft, three-dimensional environments and move without strong adhesion is still poorly understood. Understanding this pushing mechanism could reshape our view of cell migration in development, immunity, and cancer invasion. In my current research, I combine theoretical physics and quantitative modeling to understand how the cytoskeleton — especially actin and microtubules — and the plasma membrane generate, balance, and coordinate pushing forces. I develop multi-scale models that link local cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane mechanics to the global force balance needed for cells to migrate through complex environments without relying on strong adhesion.

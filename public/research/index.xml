      <description>&lt;!-- &lt;h2 style=&#34;font-weight: normal&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
Over the course of the last two decades, it became progressively clear that physical, i.e.
mechanical forces play a major role in cellular decision making and aid in regulating important
physiological processes like tissue growth and morphogenesis. To actively generate forces, cells
use a highly complex and self-organized contractile structure called the actin cytoskeleton which
allows them to explore the mechanical and geometric properties of their environment through cell-
matrix and cell-cell adhesions. These informations are then fed back to the cell, and evaluated by
means of chemical signals a process which is known as mechanotransduction. Although research
has yielded many new insights in recent years it is still puzzling how cells integrate information
from their environment into their decision-making process. Therefore, it is important to study how
cells generate forces, how the internal molecular machinery regulates them, and how these forces
transmit information in multicellular systems to understand processes such as development,
organogenesis, homeostasis or diseases like cancer. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cells interact mechanically with their environment not only by pulling but also by pushing from within, a fundamental aspect of cell mechanics that remains largely unexplored. While the role of pulling forces in sensing and migration is well established, how pushing forces allow cells to deform soft, three-dimensional environments and move without strong adhesion is still poorly understood. Understanding this pushing mechanism could reshape our view of cell migration in development, immunity, and cancer invasion. In my current research, I combine theoretical physics and quantitative modeling to understand how the cytoskeleton — especially actin and microtubules — and the plasma membrane generate, balance, and coordinate pushing forces. I develop multi-scale models that link local cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane mechanics to the global force balance needed for cells to migrate through complex environments without relying on strong adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;Cells generate and propagate contractile forces to sense, adapt, and maintain mechanical balance with their environment. While the basics of pulling forces are well known, the physical principles that link force generation within the cytoskeleton to force propagation across cells and tissues remain poorly understood. My research combines optogenetics, micropatterning, traction force microscopy, and continuum theory to reveal how actin architecture, cell size, and geometry shape both local force generation and long-range force transmission. By bridging experiments and active gel models, I aim to explain how cells dynamically regulate tension and coordinate mechanical signals at multiple scales.

&lt;p&gt;Many cellular structures, like the centriole, rely on precise protein self-assembly to build complex shapes with defined symmetries. The protein SAS-6 is essential for centriole formation because it forms dimers that self-assemble into nine-fold symmetric rings, establishing the centriole’s architecture. Recent experiments show that surfaces strongly promote this ring assembly by increasing encounter rates and forcing the structure to stay planar. In my work, I use Brownian dynamics simulations and reaction kinetics to study how surface adsorption, interaction energies, and angular constraints shape the efficiency and symmetry of SAS-6 ring formation, highlighting the physical conditions that favor robust and specific assembly.
